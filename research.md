### Overview  
We study how cells detect and degrade aberrant RNAs, and how dysregulation of this surveillance process contributes to human disease. 

<br>  

### Our questions  
* What sequence features allow an mRNA to escape NMD?  
* What cell-specific factors contribute to differential NMD sensitivity?  
* How does variable NMD sensitivity influence cellular phenotypes?

### Our tools
In our laboratory, we apply computational and experimental tools to understand how RNA surveillance shapes gene expression and contributes to disease processes. Specifically, we study RNA surveillance across biological scales - intracellular, tissue-level and across human populations - using tools ranging from RNA imaging in single cells to high-throughput genomic analyses.

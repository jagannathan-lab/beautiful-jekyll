In our laboratory, we apply computational and experimental tools to understand how RNA surveillance shapes gene expression and contributes to disease processes. Specifically, we study RNA surveillance across biological scales - intracellular, tissue-level and across human populations - using tools ranging from RNA imaging in single cells to high-throughput genomic analyses.

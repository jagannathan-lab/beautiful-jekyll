<a href="/docs/ortiz-cv.pdf">Cameron Ortiz</a> is a Junior in the BS/MS Bioengineering program at CU Denver. In his second year, he worked as a student assistant in the Neurology clinical trial department on neuro-degenerative diseases. He hopes to pursue graduate research in genetics and cell biology of FSHD in the future. 

This summer, Cameron will be doing a computational project focused using cell free DNA of individuals affected by FSHD to track disease status. Cameron is jointly mentored by Dr. Jagannathan and [Dr. Ramachandran](https://chromatindynamics.com/) in this project. We are excited to have Cameron with us this summer!

<a href="/docs/forman-cv.pdf">Thomas Forman</a> has officially joined the lab and will be our lab's first [MSTP](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/mstp) student. He will be working on understanding the role of RNA toxicity in FSHD, among other things. We are so excited for all the amazing science we will get to do together!

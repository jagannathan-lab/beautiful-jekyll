We are excited to welcome Michael Cortazar to the lab as a new postdoctoral fellow. Michael comes to us from [David Bentley's](http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/medicalschool/departments/biochemistry/Faculty/PrimaryFaculty/Pages/Bentley.aspx) lab. During his Ph. D. work, Michael studied premature Pol II transcriptional termination. In our lab, he will focus on premature translation termination and NMD.

After an awesome year-and-a-half in the lab, Elizabeth is heading off to Seattle to start grad school. She is going to be joining the MCB program at UW, and we cannot wait to see all the amazing science she is going to do there. 

We celebrated Elizabeth's last day in the lab with lunch + icecream at the food trucks, and a happy hour at the Stanley Beer Hall. We are doing to miss you terribly, Elizabeth!

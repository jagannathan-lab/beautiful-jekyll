<a href="/docs/piarowski-cv.pdf">Christina (Tina) Piarowski</a> is a first year student in the [Cell Biology, Stem Cells, and Development Program](http://www.ucdenver.edu/ACADEMICS/COLLEGES/MEDICALSCHOOL/PROGRAMS/CSD/Pages/home.aspx). Tina will study the differences in DUX4-induced gene expression in the early embryo versus muscle cells, and how these differences might inform our understanding of FSHD. We are excited to have her with us for the next couple of months!

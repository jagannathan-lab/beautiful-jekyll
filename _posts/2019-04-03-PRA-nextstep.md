Our PRA extraordinaire, Elizabeth Bonner, will be going to grad school at the [UW MCB Program](https://grad.uw.edu/about-the-graduate-school/interdisciplinary-programs/molecular-and-cellular-biology/). 

Elizabeth has made a huge difference to our young lab both with her scientific acumen and her fun personality. While we are sad for our lab's loss, we are SO excited for all that lays ahead of her, and know that she will do spectacular things at UW. Go get 'em, Elizabeth! :) <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1453406830/264/success-kid.png?1453406830" style="width:20px" />

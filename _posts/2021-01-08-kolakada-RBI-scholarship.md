Divya Kolakada, our MOLB grad student, has been selected for an [RNA Scholar Award](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/rbi/training-and-education/rna-scholars/about
) by the [RNA Bioscience Initiative](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/rbi) to support her work investigating the fate of NMD substrates and their protein products. Congrats, Divya!! 

We celebrated with a lab lunch and our usual cake and champage, albeit remotely (thanks to Zoom and Ubereats!)

Many thanks to RBI for the support!

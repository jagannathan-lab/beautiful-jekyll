We are excited to welcome <a href="/docs/baquero-cv.pdf">Laura Baquero</a> to our lab as a Professional Research Assistant. Laura graduated from MSU in 2017 and then worked as a Medical Scribe for two years before coming to us. Throughout her undergrad and since, Laura has worked on the role of RNA secondary structures in viral protein synthesis in the [laboratory of Dr. Megan Filbin-Wong](http://www.filbinlab.com/?page_id=41). In our lab, Laura will be studying the role of translation reinitiation in promoting the escape of aberrant RNAs from NMD. We are excited to have her on our team and look forward to working with her over the next two years, as she prepares to go to medical school in 2021.

We are grateful for the support of [Friends of FSH Research](http://www.fshfriends.org/) and the [Chris Carrino Foundation for FSHD](http://chriscarrinofoundation.org/) in awarding a new grant to our lab to study the role of aberrant translation in FSHD. It is a continuation of the [first grant our lab ever received](http://jagannathan-lab.org/2018-06-01-new-grant1/) and we are excited to press on with this line of investigation that we think will shed light on how and why DUX4 is toxic to cells.

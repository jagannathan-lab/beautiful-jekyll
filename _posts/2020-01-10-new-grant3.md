We are grateful for the support of Friends of FSH Research and the Chris Carrino Foundation for FSHD in awarding a new grant for our lab to study the role of aberrant translation in FSHD. It is a continuation of the first grant our lab ever received and we are excited to continue this line of investigation that we think has the potential to be transformative for FSHD research.

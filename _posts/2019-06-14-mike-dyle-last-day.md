This is pretty bittersweet as far as lab news goes. Mike Dyle will be starting his new position as a Medical Writer on Monday at Zimmer Biomet, continuing to work in the muscle space. We are sad to lose Mike, but very happy that he found an amazing next step in his career. Today was his last day, and we said goodbye in style with a Pho lunch (& took what should be unbeatable as a crappy lab photo in the process. Oh well...). Good luck, Mike!

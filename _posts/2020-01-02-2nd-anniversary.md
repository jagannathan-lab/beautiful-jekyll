Two years ago, today, my lab was a room full of boxes that I could barely walk into. Today, the lab is fully functional and we are doing the most exciting science I have ever done in my career. None of this would be possible without the wonderful people in my lab who have chosen to work with me. I am grateful to have them in my lab, and excited for what 2020 has in store!

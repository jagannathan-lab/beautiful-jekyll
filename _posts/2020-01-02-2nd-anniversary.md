Two years ago, today, our lab was a room full of boxes that I could barely walk into. Today, the lab is fully functional and we are doing the most exciting science I have ever done in my career. 
<br>   
None of this would be possible without the wonderful people in the lab - past and present - who have chosen to work in our lab, mentors and colleagues who have given freely of their time and effort to guide us, and funding agencies that have taken a chance on us. I am grateful for all that 2019 has given us, and excited for what 2020 has in store!

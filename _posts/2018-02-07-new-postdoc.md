Mike Dyle will be officially starting as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the lab on February 15 (though he is already 
in the lab helping with setting up!). Mike got his PhD at University of Iowa, where he worked with [Dr. Christopher Adams](https://medicine.uiowa.edu/diabetes/adams) on skeletal muscle atrophy. We are excited to have him on our team!

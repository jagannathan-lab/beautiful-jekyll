We have been awarded an investigator-initiated research grant by the [FSHD Society](http://www.fshdsociety.org/) to support our work on identifying the mechanism by which DUX4 inhibits nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) in the human muscle disease facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). We are grateful for the continued support from the FSHD Society for our work!

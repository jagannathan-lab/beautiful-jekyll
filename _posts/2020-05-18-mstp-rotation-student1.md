<a href="/docs/forman-cv.pdf">Thomas Forman</a> is in the first year of his graduate study (G-1) at the [CU Medical Scientist Training Program](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/mstp). Thomas will investigate the role of RNA toxicity in the pathogenesis of FSHD, with the long-term goal of understanding why the muscle might be a sensitzed tissue context for the pathological effects of disrupted mRNA metabolism. We are excited to have Thomas rotate in the lab!

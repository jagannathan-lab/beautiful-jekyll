We are excited to welcome <a href="/docs/steil-cv.pdf">Alex Steil</a> to our lab as a Professional Research Assistant. Alex graduated from University of Wisconsin -  La Crosse in 2018 with a major in Cell and Molecular Biology and a minor in Chemistry. Throughout his undergrad, Alex worked as a Research Assistant in the laboratory of [Dr. Jennifer Klein](https://www.uwlax.edu/profile/jklein/), using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to investigate site-specific oxidation in mammalian myoblasts. In our lab, Alex will study how nonsense-mediated decay becomes inhibited in the muscle disease FSHD.

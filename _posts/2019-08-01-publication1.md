Our lab's first paper is out in [WIREs RNA](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wrna.1560)! 

It's a review we wrote on why some mRNAs escape NMD and how this escape might affect cells - it's basically a summary of all the things we think about and obssesses over. Hope you enjoy reading it!

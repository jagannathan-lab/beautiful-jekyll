Divya Kolakada, our MOLB grad student, has been awarded a [Predoctoral Fellowship](https://professional.heart.org/en/research-programs/application-information/predoctoral-fellowship) by the [American Heart Association](https://www.heart.org/) to support her work investigating the fate of NMD substrates and their protein products. Congrats, Divya!! 

We celebrated with our first in-person, socially-distanced, and outdoors lab lunch since the pandemic started. It was lovely to share a meal together in person and celebrate Divya's acheivement. 

Many thanks to AHA for the support!

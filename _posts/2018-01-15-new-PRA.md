We are excited that Hilary Hoffman will be joining us as a Professional Research Assistant/Lab Manager. Hilary graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2014 and has worked at the Salk Institute and at CU Anschutz as a Research Technician and a lab manager. She brings a wealth of knowledge in molecular biology to the lab, and knows the ins and out of CU Anschutz systems.

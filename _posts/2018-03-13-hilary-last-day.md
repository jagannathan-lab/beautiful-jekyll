I guess there is a first for everything as a new lab, and today, I had to create an Alumni section in our People page. 

Hilary Hoffman, our amazing PRA, was offered and has decided to accept an administrative position at the Childrens' Hospital as a Clinical Research Coordinator. Hilary was instrumental in helping us set up our lab and was overall a wonderful person to work with. We will miss her very much. However, we are happy that she found a job that is closer to her long-term goal of becoming an administrator, and wish her the best in her new position!

We are excited to welcome Amy Campbell to our lab as a Research Instructor. Amy comes to us from the Tapscott lab at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, where she was first a postdoc and then a Staff Scientist. Amy got her PhD from the University of Pennsylvania and has several years of experience working on FSHD. Amy will continue to study the pathogenic mechanisms of FSHD with an emphasis on the role of post-transcriptional gene regulation in this devastating disease. We are thrilled to have her on our team and look forward to all the cool science we'll get to do together!

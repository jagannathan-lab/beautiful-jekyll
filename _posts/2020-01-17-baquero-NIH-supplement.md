Laura Baquero, a PRA in our lab, has been awarded a diversity supplement to our MIRA by NIH/NIGMS to study [how noncanonical translation events contribute to escape from nonsense-mediated RNA decay](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=10046108&map=y). Laura worked very hard on her proposal and we are so excited for her to have this opportunity!

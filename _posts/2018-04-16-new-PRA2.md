Elizabeth Bonner started as a Professional Research Assistant in our lab this week. Elizabeth graduated from the University of Denver in 2015 and has been working in the laboratory of Dr. Joaquin Espinosa since then. We are excited to have her on our team and look forward to working with her over the next year, as she prepares to go to graduate school in 2019.
